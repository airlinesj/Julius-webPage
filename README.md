This is web-portfolio assignment that was meant to be a learning curve

Certainly! Here’s a more fleshed-out version that’s still concise and engaging, ideal for a README file:


Welcome to my personal web portfolio — a digital space where creativity meets code. This project was developed as part of a Web Development assignment and serves as both a professional showcase and a hands-on demonstration of key front-end development skills.

The portfolio is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**, with an emphasis on clean design, responsive layout, and user-friendly navigation. It features sections such as **About Me**, **Projects**, **Skills**, and **Contact**, giving visitors a clear overview of my background, technical expertise, and work samples.

Whether you're a potential employer, collaborator, or just curious, feel free to explore and connect!
